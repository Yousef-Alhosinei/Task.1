# Task.1
# sweep servo motor: 

# Equipment List
Arduino Uno
Servo Motor
Connecting Wires

# Experiment Setup
Connect the servo motor's power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the servo motor's signal wire to pin 9 on the Arduino.
Connect the servo motor's ground wire to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Upload the example code for sweeping a servo motor from the Arduino IDE.

# Experiment Procedure
Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Go to File > Examples > Servo > Sweep to open the example code.
Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
Click the upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.
Observe the servo motor sweeping back and forth.

# Knob servo motor:
Knob control involves controlling the servo motor's position with a potentiometer (knob). After reading the analog input from the potentiometer, the Arduino transfers this input to the servo's range of motion.

# Equipment list and experiment setup:

Potentiometer
Arduino Uno
Servo Motor
Wires
# Experiment Procedure:

Connect the servo motor's power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the signal wire to pin 9 on the Arduino.
Connect the servo motor's ground wire to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to the A0 pin on the Arduino.
Connect one of the outer pins of the potentiometer to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the other outer pin of the potentiometer to the GND pin on the Arduino.
